                    <p>Angela completed her Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Psychology at Iscte University Institute of Lisbon. Her Master's thesis consisted of an original research study focused on some of the psychological antecedents of misinformation. In that process, she realized that political identity played a key role in some of the current social problems we are facing, such as the spread of misinformation, mistrust in science, and polarization. This last one drove her to make her PhD project about attitude change and complex social identities, with the main goal of explaining and predicting this phenomenon at the individual and social level.</p>
