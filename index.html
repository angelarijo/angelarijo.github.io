                    <p>Angela completed her Bachelor and Master's degrees in Psychology at Iscte University Institute of Lisbon. Her Master's thesis consisted of an original research study focused on some of the psychological antecedents of misinformation. She then worked in a computational social science group (SPAC lab) as a research assistant and is now pursuing her PhD with a project that aims to model belief change by having individual's social identities as the key predictor. Angela is highly motivated by the scientific endeuver; she likes to ask questions, to design studies that can answer them, and to learn new skills and tools that help her in that process.
                    In her free time, on a regular basis, she likes to run, to spend time with her dog and friends, and to read. By the age of five she wanted to be a cellist, and she hopes one day to be able to dedicate some time to learning this instrument.
