                    <p>Angela completed her Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Psychology at Iscte University Institute of Lisbon. Her Master's thesis consisted of an original research study focused on some of the psychological antecedents of misinformation. She then worked at SPAC lab as a research assistant and is now pursuing her PhD with a project that aims to model belief change by having individual's social identities as the key predictor. Angela is highly motivated by the scientific endeavor; she likes to ask questions, to design studies that can answer them, and to learn new skills and tools that help her in that process. </p>
